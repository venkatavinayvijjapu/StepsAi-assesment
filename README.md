# Image to Pixel Conversion Project

## Overview

This project aims to explore different methods for converting images into pixel information. We will implement two primary approaches: direct pixel extraction and using pre-trained segmentation models. Additionally, we will include functionalities for visualizing the extracted pixel information.
